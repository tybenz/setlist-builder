Verse 1:
<b>C</b>    <b>Em</b>   <b>G</b>      <b>D</b>     <b>C</b>        <b>Em</b>          <b>G</b>   <b>D</b>   [<b>C</b> <b>Em</b> <b>G</b> <b>D</b>]
I have found a peace that plows on through the storm
I have found a joy that jumps over sadness
I have found a love that lights up every room
I have found, I found You



Chorus:
<b>C</b>         <b>C</b>         <b>D</b>           <b>Em</b>                  [<b>C</b> <b>D</b> <b>Em</b>]
You are all I want, You are all I need
Everything my heart could hope for
We are longing for the glory of the Lord
'Cause we know there's so much more



Verse 2:
<b>C</b>    <b>Em</b>   <b>G</b>      <b>D</b>     <b>C</b>         <b>Em</b>      <b>G</b>   <b>D</b>      [<b>C</b> <b>Em</b> <b>G</b> <b>D</b>]
I have found a trust that teaches how to rest
I have a grace that guides me by the hand
I have found a strength that stands like a mountain
I have found, I found YOU



Bridge: 
     <b>C</b>     <b>G</b>    <b>Em</b>  <b>C</b>    <b>G</b>  <b>Em</b>                       [<b>C</b> <b>G</b> <b>Em</b>]
Only You, fill my soul (repeat)
