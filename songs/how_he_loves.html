Intro: <b>G</b>  <b>Em</b>  <b>D</b>  <b>C</b>


<b>G</b>        
He is jealous for me,
<b>Em</b>
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree,
<b>D</b>                                            <b>C</b>

When all of a sudden,
                      <b>Em</b>

Oh how He loves us,
          <b>C</b>
Oh how He loves.

<b>Em</b>

   <b>D</b>                            <b>C</b>
If grace is an ocean, we're all sinking.
   <b>G</b>
So Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss,
       <b>Em</b>
